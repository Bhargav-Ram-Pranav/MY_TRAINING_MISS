GDB is widely used in the development of complex software projects and is considered an essential tool
for debugging programs at a low level. However, it requires some familiarity with the command-line
interface and a basic understanding of the architecture of the program being debugged.
To use GDB, you typically start by compiling your program with debugging symbols, which allow GDB to
map the executable code back to the original source code. You then run GDB and provide it with the name
of the executable file to debug. From there, you can use a variety of commands to set breakpoints, inspect
variables, and step through the code.
Overall, GDB is a powerful tool that can help developers track down and fix bugs in their code, making it
an essential part of any software development toolkit.
